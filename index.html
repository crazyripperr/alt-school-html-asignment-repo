    <h3>Why ALT School?</h3>
    <p>I joined ALT School because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I wanted to be part of a community of like-minded, driven individuals</li>
        <li>The project-based learning approach aligns perfectly with how I learn best</li>
        <li>The curriculum focuses on practical, industry-relevant skills</li>
        <li>I was impressed by AltSchool's track record of producing competent engineers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Traditional education often focuses too much on theory without enough practical application.
         AltSchool's hands-on approach, combined with mentorship from industry professionals,
         provides the ideal environment for me to grow as an engineer.</p>
